  <title>Atomic combinations</title>
  <teachers-guide>
	  <para>In this chapter learners will explore the concept of a covalent bond in greater detail. In grade ten learners learnt about the three types of chemical bond (ionic, covalent and metallic). A great video to introduce this topic is: <link url="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljvX-RMv_lw&amp;feature=plcp">Veritasium chemical bonding song</link>. In this chapter the focus is on the covalent bond. A short breakdown of the topics in this chapter follows.</para>
	<list list-type="bulleted">
		<item><para><emphasis effect="bold">Electron structure and Lewis diagrams (from grade <number>10</number>)</emphasis></para>
		<para>As revision you can ask learners to draw Lewis diagrams for the first <number>20</number> elements and give the electronic structure (this was covered in grade <number>10</number>). This then leads into thinking how the elements can share electrons in a bond. Learners should recognise that there are unpaired electrons in atoms that can be shared to form the bonds.</para>
		<para>It is important to note that when drawing Lewis diagrams, we first place single electrons around the central atom and only once four electrons have been placed, do we pair electrons up. This will avoid the need to explain hybridisation. It is also important for learners to realise that the placement of electrons is arbitrary and the electrons can be placed anywhere around the atom.</para>
		</item>
		<item><para><emphasis effect="bold">Why hydrogen is a diatomic molecule but helium is a monatomic molecule</emphasis></para>
		<para>This part of the chapter is interleaved with electron structure and Lewis diagrams as these two concepts play a key role in understanding why hydrogen is diatomic and helium is monatomic. In this part learners are introduced to the idea that when two atoms come close together there is a change in the potential energy. This forms a strong foundation for explaining the energy changes that occur in chemical reactions and will be seen again in chapter <number>12</number> (energy changes in chemical reactions).</para>
		</item>
		<item><para><emphasis effect="bold">Deducing simple rules about bond formation (and drawing Lewis diagrams for these molecules)</emphasis></para>
		<para>Four cases are looked at to try to understand why bonds form. This is all about the covalent bond, so all the examples you use must be of covalent molecules (and you must also only pick examples of covalent molecular structures as covalent network structures are more like ionic networks and do not form simple molecular units). It is also important to help learners realise that a lone pair of electrons is very much dependant on the molecule that they are looking at. Lone pairs of electrons can be used under special circumstances to form dative (or coordinate) covalent bonds.</para>
		</item>
		<item><para><emphasis effect="bold">The basic principles of VSEPR and predicting molecular shape</emphasis></para>
		<para>You can build the different molecular shapes before starting to teach VSEPR from large polystyrene balls and kebab sticks or you can give your learners jellytots or marshmallows and toothpicks and get them to build the molecular shapes. Remember that the shapes with lone pairs need more space for the lone pairs and so it is not as simple as just removing the toothpick for the lone pair.</para>
		<para>This topic covers the shapes that molecules have. This is only the shapes of covalent molecular compounds, covalent network structures, ionic compounds and metals have very different three dimensional forms. This topic is important to help learners determine polarity of molecules. Two approaches are used to determine the shape of a molecule. The first one looks at molecules matching up to a general formula while the second one considers how many electron pairs are around a central atom. These two approaches can be used together to help learners fully understand this topic.</para>
		</item>
		<item><para><emphasis effect="bold">Electronegativity and polarity of bonds</emphasis></para>
		<para>It is important to note that CAPs does not give a definitive source for electronegativity values. You should use the ones found on the periodic table in the matric exams (these are the same values as the ones on the periodic table at the front of this book). Learners should be aware that they may see different values on other periodic tables. Learners must not think of the different types of bonding as being exactly defined. Also, the values for where the types of bonding transition are not exact and different sources quote different cut-off points.</para>
		<para>The simplest examples of polarity are the ideal shapes with all the end atoms the same and so you should stick to this in your explanation. You can explain this for trigonal planar molecules by using your learners. Get three girls or three boys to link hands (they all put their right hand into the centre and hold the other two learners right hands). Then they try to pull away (all learners pull equally). This is the even sharing of electrons. Now replace a girl with a boy (or vice versa) and tell the new learner to pull a bit less. This shows the uneven sharing of electrons.</para>
		</item>
		<item><para><emphasis effect="bold">Bond length and bond energy</emphasis></para>
		<para>In this final part of the chapter we return to our energy diagram and add two pieces of information: bond energy and bond length. The bond length is the distance between the two atoms when they are at their minimum energy, while the bond energy is this minimum energy. The bond energy comes up again in chapter <number>12</number> (energy and chemical change) when the topic of exothermic and endothermic reactions is covered.</para>
		</item>
  </list>
  <para>Coloured text has been used as a tool to highlight different parts of Lewis diagrams. Ensure that learners understand that the coloured text does not mean there is anything special about that part of the diagram, this is simply a teaching tool to help them identify the important aspects of the diagram, in particular the unpaired electrons.</para>

              <para>We live in a world that is made up of many complex compounds. All around us we see evidence of chemical bonding from the chair you are sitting on, to the book you are holding, to the air you are breathing. Imagine if all the elements on the periodic table did not form bonds but rather remained on their own. Our world would be pretty boring with only <number>100</number> or so elements to use.</para>
              <para>Imagine you were painting a picture and wanted to show the colours around you. The only paints you have are red, green, yellow, blue, white and black. Yet you are able to make pink, purple, orange and many other colours by mixing these paints. In the same way, the elements can be thought of as natures paint box. The elements can be joined together in many different ways to make new compounds and so create the world around you.</para>
			  <para>In Grade <number>10</number> we started exploring chemical bonding. In this chapter we will go on to explain more about chemical bonding and why chemical bonding occurs. We looked at the three types of bonding: covalent, ionic and metallic. In this chapter we will focus mainly on covalent bonding and on the molecules that form as a result of covalent bonding.</para>
              <note type="tip"><para>In this chapter we will use the term molecule to mean a covalent molecular structure. This is a covalent compound that interacts and exists as a single entity.</para></note>

<para>As we begin this section, it's important to remember that what we will go on to discuss is a <emphasis effect="italics">model</emphasis> of bonding, that is based on a particular <emphasis effect="italics">model</emphasis> of the atom. You will remember from the discussion on atoms (in Grade <number>10</number>) that a model is a <emphasis effect="italics">representation</emphasis> of what is happening in reality. In the model of the atom that you are learnt in Grade <number>10</number>, the atom is made up of a central nucleus, surrounded by electrons that are arranged in fixed energy levels (sometimes called <emphasis effect="italics">shells</emphasis>). Within each energy level, electrons move in <emphasis effect="italics">orbitals</emphasis> of different shapes. The electrons in the outermost energy level of an atom are called the <emphasis effect="bold">valence electrons</emphasis>. This model of the atom is useful in trying to understand how different types of bonding take place between atoms.</para>
      <note type="tip">
              <para>A model takes what we see in the world around us and uses that to make certain predictions about what we cannot see.</para>

<para>There are two cases that we need to consider when two atoms come close together. The first case is where the two atoms come close together and form a bond. The second case is where the two atoms come close together but do not form a bond. We will use hydrogen as an example of the first case and helium as an example of the second case.</para>

        Graph showing the change in energy that takes place as two hydrogen atoms move closer together.
      </caption>
    </figure>
    <para>Let us imagine that we have fixed the one atom and we will move the other atom closer to the first atom. As we move the second hydrogen atom closer to the first (from point A to point X) the energy of the system decreases. Attractive forces dominate this part of the interaction. As the second atom approaches the first one and gets closer to point X, more energy is needed to pull the atoms apart. This gives a negative potential energy.</para>
            <para>At point X, the attractive and repulsive forces acting on the two hydrogen atoms are balanced. The energy of the system is at a minimum.</para>
            <para>Further to the left of point X, the repulsive forces are stronger than the attractive forces and the energy of the system increases.</para>
            <para>For hydrogen the energy at point X is low enough that the two atoms stay together and do not break apart again. This is why when we draw the Lewis diagram for a hydrogen molecule we draw two hydrogen atoms next to each other with an electron pair between them.</para>

    <title>Valence electrons and Lewis diagrams</title>
    <shortcode>ESBM7</shortcode>
<para>Now that we understand a bit more about bonding we need to refresh the concept of Lewis diagrams that you learnt about in Grade <number>10</number>. With the knowledge of why atoms bond and the knowledge of how to draw Lewis diagrams we will have all the tools that we need to try to predict which atoms will bond and what shape the molecule will be.</para>
    <!--<para>We can work out the number of valence electrons in any element by looking at its position on the periodic table. Elements in group 1 all have one valence electron, elements in group 2 have 2. Elements in groups 13–18 have the group number minus 10 valence electrons. So for example chlorine (group 17) has <latex>17 - 10 = 7</latex> valence electrons. </para>-->
	<para>In grade <number>10</number> we learnt how to write the electronic structure for any element. For drawing Lewis diagrams the one that you should be familiar with is the spectroscopic notation. For example the electron configuration of chlorine in spectroscopic notation is: <spec_note>1s^{2}2s^{2}2p^{5}</spec_note>. Or if we use the condensed form: <spec_note>[He]2s^{2}2p^{5}</spec_note>. The condensed spectroscopic notation quickly shows you the valence electrons for the element.</para>
    <para>Using the number of valence electrons we can easily draw Lewis diagrams for any element. In Grade <number>10</number> you learnt how to draw Lewis diagrams. We will refresh the concepts here as they will aid us in our discussion of bonding.</para>
    <note type="tip"> <para>A <emphasis effect="bold">Lewis diagram</emphasis> uses dots or crosses to represent the <emphasis effect="bold">valence electrons</emphasis> on different atoms. The chemical symbol of the element is used to represent the nucleus and the core electrons of the atom.</para></note>

<title>Covalent bonds and bond formation</title>
<shortcode>ESBM8</shortcode>
<para>Covalent bonding involves the sharing of electrons to form a chemical bond. The outermost orbitals of the atoms overlap so that unpaired electrons in each of the bonding atoms can be shared. By overlapping orbitals, the outer energy shells of all the bonding atoms are filled. The shared electrons move in the orbitals around <emphasis effect="italics">both</emphasis> atoms. As they move, there is an attraction between these negatively charged electrons and the positively charged nuclei. This attractive force holds the atoms together in a covalent bond.</para>
<definition><term>Covalent bond</term><meaning>A form of chemical bond where pairs of electrons are shared between atoms.</meaning></definition>

    <para>We will look at a few simple cases to deduce some rules about covalent bonds.</para>
    <note type="tip"><para>Remember that it is only the <emphasis effect="italics">valence electrons</emphasis> that are involved in bonding, and so when diagrams are drawn to show what is happening during bonding, it is only these electrons that are shown.

Instead of writing the Lewis diagram for hydrogen twice, we simply write it once and use the <number>2</number> in front of it to indicate that two hydrogens are needed for each oxygen.</para></note>
            <para>And now we can answer the questions that we asked before the worked example. We see that oxygen forms two bonds, one with each hydrogen atom. Oxygen however keeps its electron pairs and does not share them. We can generalise this to any atom. If an atom has an electron pair it will normally not share that electron pair.</para>
			<para>A <emphasis effect="bold">lone pair</emphasis> is an unshared electron pair. A lone pair stays on the atom that it belongs to.</para>
			<note type="tip">
                <para>A lone pair can be used to form a dative covalent bond.</para>
            </note>
            <para>In the example above the lone pairs on oxygen are highlighted in red. When we draw the bonding pairs using lines it is much easier to see the lone pairs on oxygen.</para>

    <title>Molecular shape</title>
    <shortcode>ESBM9</shortcode>
<para>Molecular shape (the shape that a single molecule has) is important in determining how the molecule interacts and reacts with other molecules. Molecular shape also influences the boiling point and melting point of molecules. If all molecules were linear then life as we know it would not exist. Many of the properties of molecules come from the particular shape that a molecule has. For example if the water molecule was linear, it would be non-polar and so would not have all the special properties it has.</para>

      <title>Valence shell electron pair repulsion (VSEPR) theory</title>
      <shortcode>ESBMB</shortcode>
<para>The shape of a covalent molecule can be predicted using the Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory. Very simply, VSEPR theory says that the valence electron pairs in a molecule will arrange themselves around the central atom(s) of the molecule so that the repulsion between their negative charges is as small as possible.</para>
              <para>In other words, the valence electron pairs arrange themselves so that they are as <emphasis effect="bold">far apart</emphasis> as they can be.</para>
      <definition>
        <term>Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion Theory</term>
        <meaning>
          <para>Valence shell electron pair repulsion (VSEPR) theory is a model in chemistry, which is used to predict the shape of individual molecules. VSEPR is based upon minimising the extent of the electron-pair repulsion around the central atom being considered.</para>
        </meaning>
      </definition>
      <para>VSEPR theory is based on the idea that the geometry (shape) of a molecule is mostly determined by repulsion among the pairs of electrons around a central atom. The pairs of electrons may be bonding or non-bonding (also called lone pairs). Only valence electrons of the central atom influence the molecular shape in a meaningful way.</para>

In other words, the toothpicks will hold the atoms (jellytots) in the molecule together. Try to use different coloured jellytots to represent different elements.</para>

    <shortcode>ESBMD</shortcode>
<para>So far we have looked at covalent molecules. But how do we know that they are covalent? The answer comes from electronegativity. Each element (except for the noble gases) has an electronegativity value.</para>
            <para><emphasis effect="bold">Electronegativity</emphasis> is a measure of how strongly an atom pulls a shared electron pair towards it. The table below shows the electronegativities of the some of the elements.</para>
			<para>For a full list of electronegativities see the periodic table at the front of the book. On this periodic table the electronegativity values are given in the top right corner. Do not confuse these values with the other numbers shown for the elements. Electronegativities will always be between <number>0</number> and <number>4</number> for any element. If you use a number greater than <number>4</number> then you are not using the electronegativity.</para>

        <para>Electronegativity is a chemical property which describes the power of an atom to attract electrons towards itself.</para>

    <note type="aside">
      <para>The concept of electronegativity was introduced by <emphasis effect="italics">Linus Pauling</emphasis> in 1932, and this became very useful in explaining the nature of bonds between atoms in molecules. For this work, Pauling was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1954. He also received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1962 for his campaign against above-ground nuclear testing.</para>
    </note>
    <para>The greater the electronegativity of an atom of an element, the stronger its attractive pull on electrons. For example, in a molecule of hydrogen bromide (<chem_compound>HBr</chem_compound>), the electronegativity of bromine (<number>2.8</number>) is higher than that of hydrogen (<number>2.1</number>), and so the shared electrons will spend more of their time closer to the bromine atom. Bromine will have a slightly negative charge, and hydrogen will have a slightly positive charge. In a molecule like hydrogen (<chem_compound>H_{2}</chem_compound>) where the electronegativities of the atoms in the molecule are the same, both atoms have a neutral charge.</para>

      <shortcode>ESBMG</shortcode>
<para>It is important to be able to determine if a molecule is polar or non-polar since the <emphasis effect="italics">polarity</emphasis> of molecules affects properties such as <emphasis effect="italics">solubility</emphasis>, <emphasis effect="italics">melting points</emphasis> and <emphasis effect="italics">boiling points</emphasis>.</para>
      <para>Electronegativity can be used to explain the difference between two types of covalent bonds. <emphasis effect="bold">Non-polar covalent bonds</emphasis> occur between two identical non-metal atoms, e.g. <chem_compound>H_{2}</chem_compound>, <chem_compound>Cl_{2}</chem_compound> and <chem_compound>O_{2}</chem_compound>. Because the two atoms have the same electronegativity, the electron pair in the covalent bond is shared equally between them. However, if two different non-metal atoms bond then the shared electron pair will be pulled more strongly by the atom with the higher electronegativity. As a result, a <emphasis effect="bold">polar covalent bond</emphasis> is formed where one atom will have a slightly negative charge and the other a slightly positive charge.</para>
	  <para>This slightly positive or slightly negative charge is known as a partial charge. These partial charges are represented using the symbols <latex>{\delta }^{+}</latex> (slightly positive) and <latex>{\delta }^{-}</latex> (slightly negative). So, in a molecule such as hydrogen chloride (<chem_compound>HCl</chem_compound>), hydrogen is <latex>\text{H}^{\delta^{+}}</latex> and chlorine is <latex>\text{Cl}^{\delta^{-}}</latex>.</para>
